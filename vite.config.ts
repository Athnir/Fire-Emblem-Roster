  // production build", because `npm run dist:win` ALSO runs `vite build` under the hood, and the
  // Electron app's own local static server (electron/main.cjs) serves dist/ at its own root — it
  // would 404 every asset if this same sub-path prefix leaked into that build too. The workflow
  // passes the repo's own name rather than this file hard-coding it, so renaming the repo on GitHub
  // (it was Fire-Emblem-Fates-Unit-Planner) can't leave the deploy pointing at a dead path.

  // default (DNS-rebinding protection), which otherwise rejects requests coming in through
  // `tailscale serve`'s reverse proxy even though the raw LAN IP is allowed.
